## ðŸ›  Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Vsd1208>/<AgentForce_CodeBlasters>.git
cd <AgentForce_CodeBlasters>

### 2. CLI Tool
Install globally via npm:

```
npm install -g ai-pr-reviewer
```
This allows you to run the tool from the command line for local files or diffs.
### Web Interface
No installation requiredâ€”just access the web app (e.g., via the hosted version or run locally if self-hosted). The interface includes fields for GitHub/GitLab integration and direct code pasting.

### Dependencies
- Node.js (for CLI)
- Optional: API keys for cloud AI providers (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)

### GitHub Integration
1. Provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (optional for private repos or higher rate limits).
2. Enter the Repository name and Pull Request Number.
3. Click "Fetch PR from GitHub" to load and analyze the changes.

This uses GitHub's API and webhooks for real-time PR analysis.

### GitLab Integration
1. Provide a GitLab Access Token (optional for private projects).
2. Enter the Project ID and Merge Request IID.
3. Click "Fetch MR from GitLab" to load and analyze the changes.

Integrates with GitLab CI/CD for automated reviews.

### CLI Tool
Run the tool on a diff file:

```
ai-pr-review --file changes.diff --format json
```

Options:
- `--file`: Path to the diff or code changes file (required).
- `--format`: Output format (e.g., json, markdown).
- `--provider`: AI analysis provider (e.g., openai, cohere; default: local).
- `--api-key`: Your API key for cloud providers (stored locally).
- `--lang`: Programming language (e.g., javascript, python).

For full CLI options, run `ai-pr-review --help`.

### Web Interface Usage
1. Select the Programming Language from the dropdown.
2. Enter a descriptive Commit Message.
3. Paste your Code Changes (diff or raw code) into the textarea.
4. Choose an AI Analysis Provider and enter an API Key if needed.
5. Click "Analyze Pull Request" to get insights.

## Quick Demo Examples
- **Security Issues**: Analyzes for SQL injection and weak auth mechanisms.
- **Performance Issues**: Flags N+1 queries and inefficient loops.
- **Logic Errors**: Detects issues like using assignment (`=`) instead of comparison (`==`).
- **Clean Code**: Provides a best practices review on a sample of well-written code.

## Configuration
- **API Keys**: For cloud providers, keys are stored locally and never sent to external servers.
- **Custom Providers**: Support for additional AI models can be added via configuration.
